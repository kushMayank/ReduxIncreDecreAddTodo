For beginners like me to learn the concepts in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

To run this example:

1. [Download this repo](https://github.com/kushMayank/ReduxIncreDecreAddTodo/archive/master.zip) or `git clonehttps://github.com/kushMayank/ReduxIncreDecreAddTodo.git`
2. From the repo folder run:  
   `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in the browser

And also head over to http://redux.js.org/ for some great documentation.
